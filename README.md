# Main

Main is Python programm that creates map with three layers.
The first layer is layer with information about top 10
closest films' locations to your position from a certain 
year. Second layer is layer with information about all films
of certain year with certain location. Third layer shows 
statistics about opioids deaths in USA by year and state

## Conclusion

I have gathered information about last Ukrainian films,
specifically that have been taken in Lviv. Also I gathered 
an information about films of 2017 year in London and in 
Russia. Third layer helped me to determinate statistic
about opioids drug use in USA.
